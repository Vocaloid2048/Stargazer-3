What have you done?\"<br /><br />As their dance steps grow hurried more and more, fragmented snippets of the past rush into her mind through their joined fingertips.<br />In a past that stretches back further and further, she hears the sound of rain and the lamentations just before life's extinguish.

Finally, as far as her eyes can see—<br /><br />A field of drowned corpses bobbing in the deluge.<br /><br />Panic-stricken, she tries to withdraw her hand, falling backward.<br />The surroundings brighten again, the banquet's clamor resurfacing. Her dance partner gently supports her waist, as if oblivious to the ordeal that just unfolded.<br />\"What a lovely dance that was, Memokeeper. Shall we have another go?\"",
