The bloodstained air whips at their faces as the chilling howls of the wolves endlessly stir up the fear buried deep in their blood.<br />However, she never doubted that they would escape the wolf pack's pursuit.<br />As long as they wish on the \"shooting star,\" it would shine down on them. If they just chase that light in the sky, they would reach where it lies in the distance. As they continue to run with all their strength, it seems as if the light is growing ever nearer.<br />That is no \"shooting star.\" It's a woman who could fly. She calls herself the General of the Xianzhou Yaoqing. Her name is Yueyu.<br /><br />In the distance, a military force that she had never seen before comes rushing from behind her, as countless arrows flow past her head to rain down on the pursuing borisin.<br />\"Look, Neergul! The shooting star granted our wish!\"<br />She shouts joyously, never once looking back. She does not see this \"shooting star\" falling to the ground and reduces everything to silence.",

She studies in intense agony, yet learns everything quickly. She would follow Yueyu into battle and bear the general's flag. During their countless conquests, she becomes an elite warrior.<br />The battle cry would still occasionally echo in her ears from time to time, but she initially believed that was just fear.<br /><br />Until one day she closes her eyes as a warm scarlet flows across her vision. She thinks that she sees a sanguineous moon gently calling out to her, stirring up the blood in her veins.<br />Her skin begins to split inch after inch as a wild power pours into her body like roaring waves — She realizes that, with just a gentle tiptoe, she could move in unrivaled speed like a flash of light.<br />She traverses the battlefield, bathed in blood, delivering death to her enemies before they even realize what is happening. A fissure in the enemy's ranks begins to grow wider and wider.<br />As the long battle continues under a rain of blood, her movements seem to grow only faster. No one could hope to match her speed.<br /><br />Fear... That is what she sees in the eyes of her enemies. All that she feels in her body is intimidation and rage.<br />When she regains her senses, she looks back on the path she has covered to see only borisin corpses behind her, piled higher and higher.<br />The Yaoqing soldiers are looking at her from a distance, their eyes filled with surprise, admiration, and also fear.<br />She collapses to the ground.<br /><br />When she wakes up, Yueyu sits alone by her bedside as muffled voices reach her ears from outside the tent.<br />\"Didn't you see that she had no tail? That's a bit too...\"<br />\"Is it natural? That's an awful shame?\"<br />\"She used to be a borisin war slave after all...

Everyone here follows it — It is the light of the Reignbow, their spiritual support in times of great danger.<br />That's precisely why she could not believe her eyes when the Denizens of Abundance attacked again — the shooting star is now descending on them.<br />Even if there are countless Abominations of Abundance gathering there, there are also countless Yaoqing soldiers boldly fighting to the death.<br /><br />Yet the sound of the shooting star splitting the skies grows ever closer, like the footsteps of death itself. Her whole body feels cold, like she had suddenly plummeted to the icy depths of hell.<br />Under the light of the Reignbow, even the general she has always regarded as invincible is ground to dust. She desperately runs onto the battlefield, trying to bring back any survivors, until she loses consciousness in the residual light.<br />She looses a roar of rage into the air, but no one can hear her.<br />Everything is reduced to silence.<br /><br />From that day, she would have constant nightmares.

She allows the madness to seep into her blood and uses her bare hands to tear open a crimson path for her forces to advance.<br />She descends on the enemy like a meteor, and mountain-like beasts crumble to dust under the force of her attacks.<br />She single-handedly pushes the enemy armies to retreat before her soldiers' eyes.<br />\"The Merlin's Claw! The Merlin's Claw!\"<br />The weak call she heard before has completely transformed into a battle cry, as a great and primitive will wake with her infection.<br /><br />She stands still among the rain of blood and roars out in a berserk rage<br />\"I promise you all.<br />One day, I will be faster than the Reignbow's Lux Arrow.<br />One day, we shall no longer have to witness the falling of 'shooting stars.'\"<br /><br />On that day, in that rain, she is reborn and recast in blood and fire.",

She is skilled in all forms of martial arts and has honed herself into a supreme weapon. She is widely adored by Xianzhou soldiers and civilians alike as \"The Vanquishing General.\" However, she bears the burden of the Moon Rage affliction. If she were to hunt down all the abominations in her limited lifetime — then the only enemy Feixiao has would be herself.",
