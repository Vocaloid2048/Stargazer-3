Rather, she releases a steam-laden breath at the camera lens and carelessly uses her frost-coated gloves to rub at the device.<br /><br />The camera remains perfectly operable. She lifts her phone and captures the night sky — clear, cloudless, and almost never seen within the walls of Belobog. Without wind nor snow nor stratocumulus to deny her gaze, only the dark velvet of the void stand companion to the scintillating canopy made up of shimmering stars.<br /><br />Click... and sent.<br /><br />The signal isn't very good. The air congeals with the ascension of altitude. Snow and night make silent bedfellows. Not long after, the sound of clicking is followed by a series of rings. It turns out the girl just finished her manuscript: The summit, the night, the stars.<br /><br />Lynx smirks and points her lens at her tent, its shape inflating like a lung filling with breath. Again, she pressed down and snapped her shots. Click. Send.<br /><br />Ding. The screen soon lights up again. This time, what is displayed is a woman's workbench, schematics and utensils strewn beneath the darkness of dimmed lights.<br /><br />Click. Camping chairs and Lynx's favorite velvet blanket.<br />Ding. A glass of tepid milk.<br /><br />Click. A cup of black tea steaming with warmth.<br />Ding.

A mountain top view towards Belobog, gazing upon the golden waves.<br />Ding. The shimmering streets of the Administrative District outside an apartment window.<br /><br />Click.<br />Last was the resplendent aurora lights dancing in night sky in a sudden instant.<br />Ding.<br />A cute sticker follows.

At that time, she had no idea how to reply, so she brushed the inquiry off like a joke.<br /><br />However, after that, Lynx also began to think about this question over and over again herself. Was she truly interested in ancient Belobogian history or geography? Or did she actually want to avoid socializing in a city trapped in eternal winter? Or...<br /><br />Or perhaps the girl didn't even realize that, to Lynx, the way Landaus do things is pretty simple.<br /><br />\"If you want to do something, go for it.\"<br /><br />Serval was obsessed with machinery and music, so she ran the workshop and became a rock musician. Gepard wanted to protect Belobog, so he became a Silvermane Guard captain.<br /><br />Therefore, when Lynx suddenly announced to the family: \"I want to venture deep into the Snow Plains,\" it was also simple as that.<br /><br />Afraid of the cold? Then wear something warm. Afraid of the danger? Then learn survival skills. No one's done it before? Then Lynx can be the first one.<br /><br />\"After all, isn't it simple to just go from start to goal's end?\"",
