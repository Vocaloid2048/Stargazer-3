Together, they walked one step at a time on a vast glacial planet.<br />The girl gasped and stopped on the way, carefully observing the fantastical and enchanting \"lifeforms\" buried beneath the glaciers - What used to be lifeforms, at least.<br /><br />Every time she arrived home after going on scientific expeditions, it was time for \"rewards\" —<br />When she took a small bite of the cake, the mouthwatering aroma would immediately cling to the roof of her mouth. Her insignificant anticipation always gave her mother's research an inviting smell.<br /><br />Starting from their home, a planet blessed by Abundance, they boarded research aircraft and set off to more worlds.<br />Surrounded by flash bombs, silk headscarves, ribbons, and embroidery, the girl embraced joy amongst \"lifeforms\" created by spiraling and ascending data.<br /><br />\"A-Ruan, after eating Qingtuan, you must wash your fingers thoroughly before you can touch the lab bench.\"",

Her expression was hidden behind her ink-black strands of hair.<br /><br />She did not shed a single tear.<br /><br />As the night fell, layers of geometric patterns formed by data spirals appeared on the screen in the lab. They shifted, expanded, and flowed along with the sound of traditional theater songs. After peeling away the layers of the patterns, the secret she meticulously crafted and protected with care was revealed — her parents with their eyes closed. Their faces were as impassive as if they were asleep.<br /><br />\"This is a let-down. They failed to keep their promise with Grandma.\"<br /><br />\"And I, too, let them down for failing to protect them as promised.\"<br /><br />\"Only science... never lets anyone down,\" she said.<br /><br />Wanting her parents to be equal, she stopped using her previous nickname and gave herself a new name by combining each of her parents' surnames.<br /><br />Since then, whenever someone asked her about her \"home,\" there would be a flash of confusion in her eyes. She seems to have forgotten everything.<br />In such a state, she started working around the clock on her calculations. She was so engrossed in her research that she never ate regularly. When she was on a roll, she could spend entire days and nights working on research without sleeping, and only dozed off when she hit her limit.<br /><br />Soon, she was only relying on the faint glow of fyreflies to gather her research results every night. The more dismissive she was of the existing laws of life, the quicker she progressed. She totally disregarded formulas, then moved on to ignoring the meaning of life. She simply observed, assessed with her hands, held the data in her palm to feel it, then proceeded to concoct new laws for species.<br /><br />As a result, the ferns and flowers in her lab flourished ever more. They grew at a speed visible to the human sight, and ultimately filled every space in the lab. In the space between the flowers and leaves laid the serene and emotionless countenance of her parents, formed by the aggregation of \"data.\"<br /><br />The moment her sleeping \"parents\" were about to open their eyes — By then, she had nearly destroyed the existing laws of biological evolution on the entire planet, yet she still marched on toward her goal.<br />It wasn't until she looked up from her research and stared at the sky did she notice the gaze of the Erudition had descended upon her.",
