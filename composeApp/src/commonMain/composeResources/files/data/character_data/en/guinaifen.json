   "text": "As a child, Guinevere's entire world was the Lord Protector's mansion and the bustling streets before its doors.<br /><br />Her teachers said that her family has a long and distinguished history, and even this mansion has stood for a few Amber Eras. However, time did not seem to leave any traces on its stones. As if it stood apart from the rules of time and space, it forever protected this family in eternal peace and joy.<br /><br />Her father trained Guinevere's eldest brother, second-eldest brother, and eldest sister in politics. He wished to hand the future of this planet to one of the three. As for Guinevere and her younger siblings... He only wished they would have a quiet and happy life in this tranquil paradise.<br /><br />Guinevere loved her father. He was as terrifying as a ridge-tailed python when facing his political enemies. Yet in her presence, he softened and became warm and cozy, like a big fuzzy mountain hare.<br /><br />She remembered that her father would do anything for her. He would even willingly play the role of an earth spirit to be struck down by Guinevere, the heroine, at her birthday party. The birthday parties of upper-class children would often have the family's enemies turn up as well — However, her father didn't care at all about being a laughingstock for all the attendees. He was happy as long as she could be happy.<br /><br />Then, Guinevere grew up a bit. She started to hear rumors — How her father made the king a puppet, persecuted the honest courtiers, and gluttonously gained riches... She was willing to believe that all these were lies spread by his enemies. However, she knew not all of them were lies.<br /><br />Soon, however, these concerns ceased to matter.<br /><br />Everything changed when the Antimatter Legion attacked. Her father led the army to protect the royal capital, refusing to back down. Guinevere fainted when she heard the news of his death. She was already sitting inside a space shuttle when she woke up again. Her younger siblings were sobbing next to her, while her eldest brother and eldest sister were bound tightly in ropes. Her second-eldest brother said to her in a despondent tone, \"Don't untie them just yet. They are still trying to go back.\"<br /><br />Guinevere looked outside the window. Her mother was dressed in armor and had her back turned to the space shuttle slowly lifting off, taking command of servants who were still willing to fight. Further away, the Voidrangers were tearing apart the Lord Protector's mansion. Even further, entire streets were on fire, with charred corpses scattered everywhere like heaps of soil.<br /><br />For little Guinevere, it was like her entire world had been erased from the cosmos.<br /><br />...<br /><br />My home world, Court Camelot. My siblings, a dozen lot.<br />Our days, peace and joy to boot. Until Ruin Author led woes afoot.<br />Nation breached, arms they took. Legion marched, defiant we stood.<br />We siblings escaped without a root, into an IPC mine all covered in soot.<br />Meager scraps are what we fetch, homeless and foodless at a stretch.<br />Eldest brother, timid once was. Back-breaking work, to piracy he was forced.<br />Mercantile he waylaid, genteel he relayed. Hero among bandits, loots for people's benefits.<br />Hundreds of poor he led, us siblings he fed.<br /><br />...",

   "text": "When Guinevere was young, her father always told her that humans should live with dignity. However, who could manage that on Hombert-σ?<br /><br />It was a barren planet. Primitive algae, fungi, and lichen maintained an atmosphere barely able to support animal life. Among the endemic species that stubbornly proliferated in that world, almost all of them existed as genuine threats to humanity.<br /><br />Had the Interastral Peace Corporation not discovered the mineral ores hidden in the heart of this planet, no humans would have wanted to move here anyways.<br /><br />Guinevere passed all of her teenage years on this poverty-stricken planet.<br /><br />She was good at making friends and was on good terms with the other kids. The son of the poor man, the daughter of the refugee, the brother of the gambler, or the sister of the murderer... Guinevere did not care about people's background. No matter what kind of families people are from, they were equally at risk of perishing before the arrival of tomorrow on this planet.<br /><br />The IPC didn't keep a tight eye on this place. Except for those with debts or criminal charges, the IPC didn't limit the workers' freedom as long as they paid their taxes. However, if they did pay their taxes, they might not have enough money left to even buy a drink at the town's bar.<br /><br />Her father was the most reliable backbone of the family back home. Now that both father and home were lost, the duty of looking after the family fell on the shoulders of the only senior in the group — the Stone-Wall Knight. Back when they had to flee their home, the mother sternly demanded that this loyal old knight escape with the children, while she stayed behind in their homeland to watch over the last speck of dust on their barren planet.<br /><br />The old knight was once her father's closest playmate, then her father's most courageous comrade in battle, then her father's most loyal servant. And now... he became another \"father\" for the children. Guinevere didn't manage to remember his real name even till the end. She was more familiar with the knight's other name — Uncle Stone-Wall.<br /><br />A dozen starving children made their dwindling finances even worse. After a night of arguments, Stone-Wall reluctantly agreed to have the three eldest children go to work in the mines with him. However, no matter how much Guinevere begged, he refused to let her go with them.<br /><br />Night after night passed. Stone-Wall grew old and withered. His lungs became full of incurable scars, and his spine no longer stood as tall as in years past. His hands, once able to swing a kinetic hammer majestically on the battlefield, have been deformed till he could no longer hold a spoon.<br /><br />Soon, he died.<br /><br />The stone wall fell. It fell before the dawn arrived, and it didn't make a single sound. It was like a sand castle receding as the tides swelled and fell, like the soft descent of winter's withered boughs in a breeze, like an ending doomed to arrive.<br /><br />Only a world of hoarfrost exists beyond the stone wall.<br /><br />Her elder brothers soon became interstellar pirates. Guinevere can fill her stomach again. However, she was also faintly aware that she had further strayed from her father's creed and embarked on a life even less respectable.<br /><br />Therefore, when the IPC's soldiers put cuffs on Guinevere and handed her over to the Cloud Knights together with her younger siblings, she breathed a long sigh of relief.<br /><br />People all claim the folks of the Xianzhou are very kind. She thought that the Cloud Knights would definitely allow her entire family to die together in dignity.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Folly befell my brother's mind. A Xianzhou ship, his raid entwined<br />Those of Xianzhou, just and upright. Thunder and storm, willed in their might.<br />To Xianzhou, my brother offered compliance. For us siblings, he pleaded forbearance.<br />Xianzhou knights, blessed with grace. Xianzhou fleet, we get to embrace.<br />Our brother pardoned, our burdens lessened.<br />To the school, our young'uns go. Teaching skills was my dear Ms. Yo.<br />A future elsewhere, brother urged me to prepare. Gratitude to pay, I chose here to stay.<br />In Aurum Alley I shine. Fame and fortune, I'm fine.<br /><br />...",

   "text": "\"Sorry, sorry! I ran into someone who was injured, so I got here later than I thought — Ah. Little Gui, you're still singing? Then I'll shut up.\"<br /><br />\"Yo! Shangshang is here! Fam, lemme introduce her to y'all. She's our surprise guest tonight! The Cloud Knights' genius newcomer — Ms. Sushang! C'mon fam, post in the chat 'welcome Ms. Sushang'~\"<br /><br />\"H—Hello everyone. I'm Sushang... Stop with the 'genius newcomer' thing! Don't make me seem more than what I am. My boss is gonna give me an earful if they hear about it.\"<br /><br />\"Just gimme a sec here, Shangshang. My doggerel is just missing its last bit. You're here right on time since it's all about you~\"<br /><br />...<br /><br />Then a thug crossed my path, a timely heroine dealt with his wrath.<br />You may ask, which heroine could it be? And I answer, Li Sushang, you see.<br />Ever since then, I'm no longer alone. With a heroine like her, I have a much livelier tone.<br />And I have fans in a throng, enjoying my awesome song.<br />My fans whom I adore, always ask for more.<br />But my story runs too long, I can't go on and on.<br />Let's wrap it up for now, if you allow, I'll save it for another wow.<br /><br />...<br /><br />\"Nice! Nice! Let's all give it up for Little Gui, everyone! But... I don't quite remember this heroic feat?\"<br /><br />\"Mr. Xiyan told me that stories featuring damsel-in-distress scenarios are popular, hence my decision to write it this way. If it's not to your liking.... Thank you CatEmanator<nobr>8190</nobr> for the Diting Storm gift! Thanks so much!\"<br /><br />\"Thank you so much! ...It doesn't matter how you write it! The stuff you do are all fun anyways.\"<br /><br />\"Alrighty. Now that Shang-Shang is here, let's do the Show-Show! We can now finally present the duo skit we've been practicing for a long time~ Here, Shangshang, gimme the chordophone. I, Little Gui, is now gonna sing Teng Xiao Slaying the Serpent!\"<br /><br />\"This section isn't easy to perform.\"<br /><br />\"True. Any expert here would know that Teng Xiao Slaying the Serpent has singing, music, and fight scenes. One person can't do it all.\"<br /><br />\"And that is why I'm here! So how do you want to do this?\"<br /><br />\"Simple~ Today I'm gonna play the role of Teng Xiao, the previous Luofu general. I'll bring peace to the nation and all shall bow before my majesty.\"<br /><br />\"And me?\"<br /><br />\"You'll play the serpent getting slain! Where are you going, puny snake? Eat~ My~ Sword~\"<br /><br />\"Ahh! It hurts... Guinaifen! I've had enough of you!\"",
