Hello Trailblazers,<br>
I am Voc, the developer of Stargazer. In early July, my team (Coding Band) initiated the "Stargazer" upgrade plan. Currently, we are developing the remastered version while providing limited maintenance for the currently released Stargazer 2, which will cease maintenance at the end of September. Subsequently, Stargazer 3 (remastered version) will take over. (The reasons for the upgrade will be supplemented later.)

After a month of development on the remastered version, we will conduct a one-month early version beta test. We sincerely invite all Trailblazers to apply to become beta testers. Please refer to the recruitment conditions and requirements below:

### FAQ

**Q: I see that your app has a login feature. Is it necessary to log in to use it?**<br>
**A:** Most features of Stargazer 3 can be used without logging in. For example, you can view your assisted characters by querying the UID without logging in. However, if you log in, you can view all your character data by clicking on the user avatar at the top of the homepage.

**Q: Are you sure? Does the login feature require entering account credentials on the official website?**<br>
**A:** Yes, to lower the technical barrier, we provide this feature within the app. We assure you that we do not intercept any sensitive information such as account credentials. We only obtain the cookies after you log in to the official website. You can also choose to manually input the cookies, which will only be stored locally and not uploaded to the server.

**Q: Isn't this supposed to be a remastered version? Why does it look the same as the previous version?**<br>
**A:** Our focus is on optimizing user experience, code structure, project structure, and reducing maintenance costs. Therefore, the interface of the remastered version will be similar to the old version. If you have any suggestions for interface improvements, please feel free to raise an issue on our Discord server (please avoid casual chatting).

**Q: You've been working on it for a month, but there are only a few pages. Why?**<br>
**A:** I (yes, it's just me) aim to maintain a work-life balance during the rewrite and avoid working non-stop. Sometimes unexpected situations arise, causing delays. Please understand that one person cannot work as efficiently as two.

**Q: Can you explain the beta testing process?**

**Phase 1 (Basic Features) will test the following:**
- Character, Light Cone, and Relic data and recommendations
- User character showcase and detailed character information
- Home page and settings (excluding language)
- UID search

**Phase 2 (Data Features) will test the following:**
- Chaos Memories, Fictional Narratives, and Training Rankings
- Warp Simulation and Warp Analysis
- Home page custom layout
- Ads and in-app purchase donations

**Phase 3 (Advanced Features) will test the following:**
- Axis Function
- Notification features (stamina full, app updates)
- Tablet interface adaptation

**Q: What about the previous features, like the Axis Function?**<br>
**A:** The previous features (including the Axis Function) will be gradually added during the beta testing phases according to the schedule. We will hold a vote later to decide on the most requested features.

**Q: An application sent to the developer at 3 AM (HKT)**<br>
**A:** ( ˘•ω•˘ ) Sorry, I am sleeping at that period. I will reply to your message in the morning. Please respond as soon as possible.
